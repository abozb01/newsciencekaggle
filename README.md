# Data Science Workflow Example

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a typical data science workflow using the Iris dataset. The workflow includes loading data, defining a machine learning model, fitting the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's accuracy.

## Overview

This example uses the Iris dataset, which is fetched from the `sklearn` library. The model defined is a Decision Tree Classifier.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
